# RockPaperScissorProject
This project is a simple Rock Paper Scissor game based on OpenCV and Mediapipe

I've used OpenCV to read the video from webcam and mediapipe to detect hand gestures

### MAKE SURE YOU USE Python 3.7 to 3.10 FOR MEDIAPIPE SUPPORT. OTHER PYTHON VERSIONS WON'T SUPPORT MEDIAPIPE AND WILL THROW ERROR
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mediapipe==0.10.8 (from versions: none) ERROR: No matching distribution found for mediapipe==0.10.8 pycharm
